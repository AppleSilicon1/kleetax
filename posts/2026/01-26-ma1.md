  <blockquote><b>Writer's Note</b><br>After a lot of excitement, I finally received my PFA designation this month. For many students in Toronto and around the country, January and the coming months will be for deciding where to study! While some will stay close to home, many others may study in another province — even abroad! On that note, it is fitting that the next series, <i>Matriculating Abroad</i>, focuses on exactly that! I look forward to providing a basic overview of our tax system's treatment of cross-boarder situations. While I write this series with students in mind, many concepts apply equally to anyone with ties abroad.<br>On behalf of KLee Tax, happy reading! We hope you get into your dream schools! - <b>Ken Lee, PFA</b></blockquote>

  <p>Good morning Toronto! When studying or residing abroad, it is possible for an individual to be considered a tax resident in both the foreign country and in Canada. How does Canada treat one of its tax residents abroad? What is a tax resident? In today's article, we will explore the Act's provisions pertaining to international taxation, deeming rules, and implications of these rules for Canadians studying abroad.</p>
  <p>To begin, there are multiple definitions of what constitutes a ‘resident’ in Canadian law. For example, Canadian immigration law broadly recognizes 4 categories of immigration status: Canadian Citizens, Canadian Permanent Residents, Refugee/Asylum claimants, and Temporary Residents (those with visit/study/work permits). Your status under the our immigration laws are fairly explicit. If you are a Canadian citizen, you can be assured that your immigration status is cemented — barring renunciation or revocation of your citizenship.</p>
  <p>However, under the Income Tax Act, the concept of a Canadian tax resident is more nuanced. For reasons which will become clear, a Temporary Resident with a study permit can be considered a factual resident for tax purposes, while a Canadian citizen could also be considered a non-resident.</p>
  <p>While the ITA has other residency statues, for relevancy’s sake, this article will consider the implications of the following three:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Factual Residents (FRs)</li>
    <li>Factual Non-Residents (FNRs)</li>
    <li>Deemed Non-Residents (DNRs)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>FNRs and DNRs are taxed in the same manner. The following table distinguishes the differences in taxation between FRs and FNRs/DNRs.</p>

  <p><i>*Former FRs may retain their RRSPs and TFSAs after becoming a NR without immediate penalty, although they are not allowed to make new contributions. To be discussed in a future article.</i></p>
  <p>As can be seen, while FRs are taxed on their worldwide income and are subject to both Canadian federal and provincial taxes, they also enjoy access to tax-privilaged accounts, benefits, and tax credits. This is contrasted to NRs that, while only subject to federal taxes on their Canadian-source income, do NOT enjoy the aforementioned privilages that residents recieve.</p>
  <p>While the Income Tax Act does not define the term “resident,” the courts—most notably in Thomson v. Minister of National Revenue—have held that the question of residence, and thus liability for Canadian taxes, is reliant on the degree to which an individual has established and maintains their ordinary life in a given place.</p>
  <p>Thus, the question of weather an individual is a factual resident, even after leaving Canada to live/study abroad, depends on the nature of their residential ties to Canada while abroad. Revenue Canada considers both signifiant and secondary ties in considering residency. No single combination of ties is, by itself determinative.</p>
  <p>Signiciant residential ties include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dwelling place maintained in Canada;</li>
    <li>Spouse in Canada; and/or</li>
    <li>Dependents in Canada</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Secondary residential ties MAY include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal property in Canada (i.e. furniture, cars, and clothing);</li>
    <li>Social ties with Canada;</li>
    <li>Economic ties with Canada (i.e. Canadian bank accounts, retirement savings plans, credit cards, and investments);</li>
    <li>Keeping provincial medical insurance coverage (OHIP);</li>
    <li>Retaining a Canadian Driver's Licence;</li>
    <li>Having a registered vehicle in Canada;</li>
    <li>Retaining a valid Canadian passport;</li>
    <li>Retaining a valid Canadian phone number;</li>
    <li>Retaining membership in Canadian unions or professional organizations;</li>
    <li><b>AND MUCH MORE</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Other factors that assist the CRA in determining an individual's residency status MAY include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Intention to return to Canada;</li>
    <li>Frequently and length of visits to Canada; and/or</li>
    <li>Residential ties in the foreign country</li>
  </ul>
