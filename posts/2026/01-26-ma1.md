  <blockquote><b>Writer's Note</b><br>After a lot of excitement, I finally received my PFA designation this month. For many students in Toronto and around the country, January and the coming months will be for deciding where to study! While some will stay close to home, many others may study in another province — even abroad! On that note, it is fitting that the next series, <i>Matriculating Abroad</i>, focuses on exactly that! I look forward to providing a basic overview of our tax system's treatment of cross-boarder situations. While I write this series with students in mind, many concepts apply equally to anyone with ties abroad.<br>On behalf of KLee Tax, happy reading! We hope you get into your dream schools! - <b>Ken Lee, PFA</b></blockquote>
