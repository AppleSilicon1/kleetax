  <p>Good morning Toronto! While we do some things similarly to the United States, our neighbours to the south approach taxation quite differently regarding taxes! Today's article aims to provide a brief overview of the US tax system and key considerations for Canadian factual residents that intend to study in the US.</p>
  <p>The US tax system uses several different terms to the Canadian tax system, which are summarized below:</p>

  <p>A signficiant variatiopn between our tax systems is the manner of determining tax residency and liability. For example, if any Canadian or foreign national maintained sufficient residential ties to Canada and was not deemed a non-resident as a result of a tax treaty, they would be considered fully liable for all worldwide income. In other words, the Canadian tax system is blind to immigration status in considering tax liability. In constrast, either citizenship or residence in the US determine tax liability. For today's article, we will consider the following statues:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>US Citizens</li>
    <li>Resident Aliens</li>
    <li>Non-Resident Aliens</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The US is one of two countries in the world that operate a citizen-based taxation regime — the other being Eritrea. The effect of this regime is that US citizens (USCs) are treated as US tax residents. A USC will NEVER be treated as a non-resident, barring renounciation of citizenship. Furthermore, US citizenship is conferred on a jus soli basis, meaning that any individual born to the US — regardless of the parents' status — are USCs.</p>
  <div class="box">
	   <p><b>Example 1</b></p>
    <p>Sophie was born in the US and left when she was young. Today, she is now a Canadian Citizen. She has not lived in the US for almost two decades.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sophie's long residence in Canada and her lack of ties to the US do not alter her US citizenship. Hence, despite being resident in Canada, she is treated like a US tax resident.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>Under US law, an 'alien' is anyone who is not a US citizen. An alien is a US resident if they meet either of the below tests:
  <ul>
    <li>Green Card Test (GCT): Held Lawful Permanent Residence (LPR) status at any point during the year.</li>
    <li>Substantial Presence Test (SPT): Spent at least 31 days in the US in the current year AND a weighted total of 183 days over the current year and the two preceding years.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In the context of this article, any individual that holds a student/research visa (i.e. F-1, M-1, or J-1) or are the family member of an aforementioned individual are considered exempt individuals for the SPT. Thus, students, in addition to all other individuals that are not USCs AND failed BOTH the GCT & SPT will be considered to be 'Non-Resident Aliens (NRAs)', whom are taxed only on US-source income. 
  <p>USCs and Resident Aliens are taxed in the same manner, both being liable to tax on all worldwide income. In addition, USCs and RAs living abroad are subject to extensive reporting requirements. First, if the aggregate (combined) value of all bank accounts are over $10k USD at any point during the year, the taxpayer must file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR). Furthermore, those holding financial assets that have an aggregated value of over $50k USD must file an information return with the IRS under Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). FATCA also compels foreign government and foreign financial institutions to report accounts held by USCs and RAs to the IRS.
  <p>While Canada also requires its own tax residents to report foreign assets that exceed a certain threshold under the T1135/T1134 regime, FATCA is significantly more far-reaching due to it's arguable intrusion on the sovereignty of foreign jurisdictions. To that end, the US' 'privileged' powers expands to its tax treaties. As discussed in <a href="https://kleetax.ca/posts/2026/01-26-ma1/"><i>Matriculating Abroad: Understanding Canadian Tax Residency</i></a>, tax treaties have tie-breaker rules which aim to deem an individual that would be considered a tax resident in two jurisdictions to be resident of only one for taxation purposes. With respect to the Canada-US Tax Treaty, Paragraph 2 of Article XXIX provides that:
  <blockquote>Except as provided in paragraph 3, nothing in the Convention shall be construed as preventing [the US] from taxing [...] its citizens [...] as if there were no convention between the United States and Canada with respect to taxes on income and on capital.</blockquote>
  <p>The 'saving clause' of the treaty specifically prevents USCs from claiming tie-breaker provisions which may assign residency to Canada. This means that a US citizen residing in Canada would, in effect, remain resident in both jurisdictions, and be subject to tax on their worldwide income in both jurisdictions.

    <p>Sophie was born in the US and left when she was young. Today, she is now a Canadian Citizen. She has not lived in the US for almost two decades.</p>

    </ul>

Canadian generally have 4 sources of income (not-including )

  

  <p>In all, the rules surrounding residency status and international taxation can be extremely convoluted. Generally, where multiple jurisdictions are concerned, taxation can become extremely tricky, extremely quickly. In these cases, having professional advice can be crucial in fully understanding your rights and responsibilities in each country. In the next article, join us as we discuss the implications of Canada-US taxation.
