		<p>Good morning Toronto! Here is what's breaking news today. </p>
        <p>The new Minister of Finance, Dominic LeBlanc, in a 10:45am press conference, announced significant changes to the capital gains tax. These changes will involve the increase of the inclusion rate from 50% to 66.6% for portions of capital gains exceeding CDN $250,000 annually. The expected changes have been lobbied against by Canadian Landlords.</p>
        <p>In a statement released to KLee Tax, the Ontario Landlords Association president J.P Wiser condemned the increase, noting that "many of our members will be subject to this rule should they sell their properties on account of their long-term ownership." Wiser went on to call the changes "a slap in the face for not just our members, but all Canadians in general"</p>
        <p>Of note, LeBlanc's proposed changes must clear the House of Commons and Senate before coming into force. He is expected to introduce the Bill to amend the <i>Income Tax Act</i> on the next sitting of the house of commons. LeBlanc replaced outgoing Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland after her sudden resignation late lst year. LeBlanc's office on Parliment Hill has not responded to our request for comment as of writing this article.</p> 
        <p>This is a developing story. More to follow.</p>
