		  <p>Good morning Toronto! As you may well be aware, on 1 Feb 2024, US President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14193, Imposing Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border. Today, we will look at how the new tariffs affect Canadian businesses, and X.</p>
      <p>First, let’s look at the new tariffs. Tariffs are a form of taxes that are paid to the government on imported goods. In the US, the list of goods subject to tariffs are listed on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The executive order will apply a tariff of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>25% on “All articles that are products of Canada” (§2(a))</li>
        <li>20% on “energy or energy resources”, such as (but not limited to) gas, natural gas, crude oil, and coal. (§2(b))</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For the purposes of §2(a), products of Canada mean all goods that originate or are imported for Canada. Note that a ‘product of Canada’ for the purposes of these tariffs and a ‘Product of Canada’ for classification purposes under other trade agreements (such as the USMCA) and/or labelling purposes for product packaging are subject to completely different requirements, which will be covered later.</p>
      <p>Quite frankly, The EO signed by President Trump will be devastating to Canadian consumers and businesses alike. Without intervention, the tariffs will significantly affect the cost of Canadian products that enter the US market. Preliminary estimates by PricewaterhouseCoopers indicate that the 25% goods tariff and 10% energy tariff will result in about $73 billion and $13 billion USD of tariffs paid to the US government annually.</p>
      <p>Importantly, the provisions of the tariff, specifically §2(h), state that:</p>
      <blockquote>(h) For avoidance of doubt, duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321 shall not be available for the articles described in subsection (a) and subsection (b) of this section.<br>   – Relevant Section</blockquote>
      <p>Essentially, the duty-free de minimis provisions under §321 of the Tariff Act, will no longer apply to Canadian goods and energy products. This provision is moreso applicable to businesses that sell to US customers, as the de minimis treatment provided an exemption for products under US$800/day per each receiving American business/customer from duty taxes on shipments arriving to the US. It is because of the de minimis treatment that companies that ship their products from foreign countries, such as Temu and Shein, are able to be profitable.</p>
      <p>The imposing of these US tariffs, and our retaliatory tariffs on American goods (also 25%) will have marked consequences for both Canadian businesses that have business operations in the US, and the Canadian consumer as a whole. At the minimum, Canadian businesses can expect that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The tariffs will raise the cost to export/import goods to/from the US. The cost of the tariffs are such that businesses will have no choice BUT to pass on the costs to the consumers.</li> 
        <li>Canadian products will become less competitive, and thus less popular, in the American market.</li>
        <li>There will be significant volatility in the USD/CAD exchange rate. The tariffs have already prompted security concerns in the Canadian dollar, which has affected its stability and purchasing power.</li> 
        <li>Businesses with operations/sales presence in the US can expect significant supply chain disruptions due to the new need to clear previously tariff/duty free shipments with US Customs & Border Protection.</li>
