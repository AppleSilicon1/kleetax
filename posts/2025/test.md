      <p>Commentary here.</p>
    </div>
    <p>As with many other jurisdictions, wills generally need to undergo <b>probate</b>, the process where a will is validated by a court and when the estate trustee(s) (executor) is recognized. It is generally needed if the deceased owned real estate, other assets, and/or there are concerns/conflicts regarding the validity of the will/executor. If the deceased died <b>intestate</b> (without a will), an estate trustee(s) is appointed as part of the normal probate process. Should intestacy occur, assets are divided in accordance with SLRA provisions. To that end, Ontario also charges probate fees (<b>Estate Administration Tax</b>), equivalent to <b>1.5%</b> of the portion of the estate valued above $50k.</p> 
    <blockquote>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act (other than paragraph 126(1.1)(a)), a person is deemed not to be resident in Canada at a time if, at that time, the person would, but for this subsection and any tax treaty, be resident in Canada for the purposes of this Act but is, under a tax treaty with another country, resident in the other country and not resident in Canada.<br>  - §205(5), Income Tax Act</blockquote>
    <p>One of the key duties of the estate trustee(s) is to ensure that any and all debts/liabilities are <b>fully discharged</b> (paid) before distributing any monies or assets to beneficiaries. Specifically, there is an <b>order of priority</b> for debts to be paid, as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Estate administration/probate fees</li>
      <li>Funeral Expenses</li>
      <li>Secured creditors (such as car loans and mortgages)</li>
      <li>Tax debts owed to the CRA/provinces</li>
      <li>Unsecured creditors (such as credit cards)</li>
      <li>Beneficiaries list in the will/according to law</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While debts are not inheritable*, the trustee(s) can be held <b>personally responsible for parts of the debt if they improperly distribute assets</b>, up to the amount that was wrongly distributed. If the estate does not have the funds to discharge all its debts, then the estate is <b>insolvent</b>, and the beneficiaries receive nothing. </p>
