		<p>Good morning Toronto! Here's what's breaking news on Canada's financial forefront this week. </p>
        <p>On Monday, 24 Feburary 2025 at 6AM EST, the NETFILE and eFILE services will open for individuals and tax professionals to file their T1 Personal Income Tax and Benefit Return for the 2024 Tax Year. This year:</p>
        <p>There are minor bumps to the Basic Personal Amount (the amount of money you can make before being taxed), to $16,129 and $12,747 for the federal and provincial portion of your tax return respectively. This year, the TFSA limit remains unchanged, at $7000 dollars. </p>
        <p>Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contribution rates have also seen moderate increases for workers subject to the second CPP ceiling (CPP2). In 2024, the government changed CPP contribution rates in an effort to boost future pensioners' payments. The Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) for the first portion of CPP (CPP1) was slightly raised to $71,300, less a $3500 exemption amount. Employees can therefore expect to pay a maximum of $4,034.10 (or 5.95%) in CPP1 contributions. If you earn above this, up to the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YAMPE) of $81,200, employees can expect to pay an additional $396 in CPP2 contributions. (Double the contribution amounts if you are self-employed. As a reminder, minors are exempt from paying into CPP, and can expect a refund if their employers deducted CPP on their paycheque.)</p> 
        <p>This is a developing story. More to follow.</p>
        <p>That's all for tax season! Make sure to collect those slips and file by 30 April 2025 (if you are anticipated to owe taxes) to avoid late-filing penalties!</p>
