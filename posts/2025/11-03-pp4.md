  <p>If a corporation only has one PE, it follows that 100% of its taxable income will be taxed in that province. However, if a corporation has multiple PEs, the corporation's taxable income and SBD must be allocated between the provinces. ITR §402(3)(a) provides that both of these allocations are made by averaging the percentages of wages paid and gross revenue earned in each PE.</p>
  <div class="box">
	  <p><b>Example 3</b></p>
    <p>Sabine owns PieCo, which has small pie factories in both BC and Ontario. In 2025, PieCo’s projected wages paid and gross revenue are $500k and $1m, respectively. In Ontario, PieCo will pay $300k in wages and earn $800k in gross revenue.</p>
    <p>It can be assumed that PieCo qualifies to claim the full SBD.</p>
