		<p>Good morning Toronto! Here's what's breaking news on Canada's financial forefront this week.</p>
        <p>Suppose you are studying at a post-secondary institution – such as a college or university – or an institution where you gain skills for jobs – like trade schools. In that case, you can take advantage of the Tuition Tax Credit. The tax credit is calculated by multiplying eligible tuition amounts and the percentage of the lowest tax bracket. Your educational institution will provide Form T2202 to certify the eligible tuition amount paid, which is then inputted onto Schedule 11 of your tax return.</p>
        <p>This tax credit can only offset income taxes already paid/owed by the student. If there is any amount left over, this can be transferred to a qualifying family member (QFM) – a spouse/common-law partner, your parents/grandparents, and/or your partner’s parents/grandparents – to a maximum of $5000 of tuition. Unlike other tax credits, the Tuition Tax Credit must be claimed as soon as you have enough taxable income to pay taxes on.</p>
        <p>Let's do an example. Paula is a Canadian citizen, resident in Ontario, who studied at MacMaster University. Her tuition was $10000 in both 2023 and 2024. Her income was $10000 (2023) and $20000 (2024) and she owed $0 and $220 in taxes in those years respectively. Thus:</p>
        <p>2023: Paula does not have any taxes to pay as her income is below the basic personal limit, preserving the full value of her tax credit. The lowest tax bracket is 15%, so her tuition tax credit is $1500. She transfers the full maximum of $5000 of her tuition paid ($750 of her tax credit) to a QFM. Hence, she has $750 of remaining credit that carries forward to the next year. 
        <p>2024: Assuming that the tax brackets remain unchanged from 2023, Paula still has a $750 credit from 2023 and a new $1500 credit from 2024. Because we cannot elect to ‘carry forward’ the tuition tax credit to future years, we must use it to reduce her taxes now. Paula’s tuition tax credit is now $2080. She chooses to NOT transfer amounts to a QFM.<p> 
        <p>2025: Paula is now working, with her annual income projected to be $50,000. Her federal taxes will be $4700. After using the full tax credit, her owing federal taxes is $2620.</p>
        <p>Warning: for students considered a resident of Ontario, Saskatchewan, or Alberta: The tuition tax credit does not offset provincial taxes owed.<p>
        <p>Obviously, you cannot be considered to be resident in 2 separate provinces for tax purposes. According to Revenue Canada:
        <blockquote>1.3 Therefore, the province you have the most residency ties in on December 31 of each year is the province you will be resident of for provincial tax purposes.<br>  – Income Tax Folio S5-F1-C1, Determining an Individual’s Residence Status</blockquote>
