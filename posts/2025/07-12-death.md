    <p>Good morning Toronto! As is commonly said, there are two things that one cannot avoid in this life: death and taxes. In this article, we will explore what happens when someone dies in Canada, from an estate administration and a tax perspective.</p>
    <p>First, the laws that govern the administration of wills and estates are set by each province or territory. Hence, while they are, in many regards, extremely similar, there are minute details which differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In Ontario, the Acts that are of concern for this article are Succession Law Reform Act (SLRA), the Estates Act, and the Trustee Act. Considering that the vast majority of the reader base is in Ontario, this article will focus on the regulstions in Ontario, although it can be expected that other jurisdictions are fairly similar in the below processes.</p>
    <p>As with many other jurisdictions, wills generally need to undergo probate, the process where a will is validated by a court and when the estate trustee(s) (executor) is recognized. It is generally needed if the deceased owned real estate, other assets, and/or there are concerns/conflicts regarding the validity of the will/executor. If the deceased died intestate (without a will), an estate trustee(s) is appointed as part of the normal probate process. Should intestacy occur, assets are divided in accordance with SLRA provisions. Furthermore, Ontario charges probate fees (Estate Administration Fees), equivalent to 1.5% of the portion of the estate valued above $50k.</p> 
    <p>One of the key duties of the estate trustee(s) is to ensure that any and all debts/liabilities are fully discharged (paid) before distributing any monies or assets to beneficiaries. Specifically, there is an order of priority for debts to be paid, as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Estate administration/probate fees</li>
      <li>Funeral Expenses</li>
      <li>Secured creditors (such as car loans and mortgages)</li>
      <li>Tax debts owed to the CRA/provinces</li>
      <li>Unsecured creditors (such as credit cards)</li>
      <li>Beneficiaries list in the will/according to law</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While debts are not inheritable*, the trustee(s) can be held personally responsible for parts of the debt if they improperly distribute assets, up to the amount that was wrongly distributed. If the estate does not have the funds to discharge all its debts, then the estate is insolvent, and the beneficiaries receive nothing. </p>
    <p>*If the debt was a joint debt, or if another person cosigned for the deceased's debt, that person is still fully liable for the outstanding balance. </p>
    <div class="box">
	    <p><b>Example 1</b></p>
      <p>Shane, ordinarily resident of Ontario, passes away. His estate is comprised of his apartment, worth $400k and his bank account, with a $50k balance. However, in his life, Shane was seriously tax delinquent and did not fully pay his business income taxes. Hence, his tax debt is $510k. He has left everything to his only son. He has no other debts. Pending the sale of the apartment, the executor initially distributed the $50k cash to his son.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The estate's liabilities are greater than its assets, hence there would not be anything left for any beneficiaries, irregardless of the fact that Robert left everything to his son.</li>
        <li>In this case, the executor is personally responsible for 50k of the debt, the portion they distributed before discharging all the debts.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>From a tax perspective, there are several tax liabilities that arise on the death of a taxpayer. Chiefly, the Act considers death to trigger a deemed disposition event. On the date of death, the capital property* of the deceased are considered to have been sold at fair market value and immediately reacquired. This notional sale triggers a capital gains event which is reportable and taxable on the final income tax return. However, capital gains are included as income at 50% of the total applicable capital gain/loss. </p>
    <p>*Capital property is ‘any property which, if sold, would result in a capital gain or a capital loss’. Common types of capital property include houses, securities, and land. The principle residence usually will qualify for the Principle Residence Exemption, amounting to no capital gains.</p> 
    <p>However, an exception to the deemed disposition rules are registered accounts. In particular, RRSPs and RRIFs are treated as deemed withdrawals, as if the entire value of the account was withdrawn on the date of death. Hence, on the final return, the full value of these accounts are included as ordinary income. For obvious reasons, if these portfolios have significant holdings, this event triggers significant tax liability for the estate. </p>
    <p>Contrastingly, TFSAs retain their tax-free status to the date of the deceased's death, but any income or gains incurred after that date are taxable. In both cases, there are various provisions in the Act that allow for a continuation of the tax-advantaged status of these accounts. These special rollover rules are to be discussed in another article.</p>
    <p>Finally, the estate trustee(s) is responsible for filing the final income tax return, covering 1 January of the year of the death to the date of death. As with any other tax return, it must include all income during that time, as well as proceeds of deemed disposition or withdrawal. The deadline for this return is: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>For deaths occuring between 1 January - 31 October, 30 April of the following year</li>
      <li>For deaths occuring between 1 January - 31 October AND the deceased had a business, June 15 of the following year</li>
      <li>For deaths between 1 November - 31 December, 6 months after the date of death</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The trustee(s) also have a choice to include certain types of income on a separate 'optional' tax return, which may significantly reduce total taxes owed. When correctly used, certain types of income are reported separately, which reduces taxes by allowing the estate to use lower tax brackets duplicate non-refundable tax credits (such as the Basic Personal Amount). Each optional return is effectively treated as a separate taxpayer for calculation purposes, which can significantly lower the overall tax payable. There are three optional returns:</p>
    <div class="table-wrapper">
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Type of Optional Return</th>
          <th>Eligible Income</th>
          <th>Income Received Periods</th>
          <th>Filing Deadline</th>
          <th>Payment Deadline (Balances Owing)</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Right or Things</td>
          <td>Income was EARNED/declared, but not received before the individual died, such as salaries, bonuses, dividends, etc., but NOT including capital gains</td>
          <td>No limit</td>
          <td>Later of 1 year after the date of death OR 90 days after the CRA sends the Notice of (Re)Assessment for the Final Return</td>
          <td>Same date as Final Return due date</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Business Income</td>
          <td>Income from the taxpayer's business, provided the taypayer was a sole proprietor or partner AND the fiscal year-end of the business is not December 31*</td>
          <td>From the date of the fiscal year-end of business to date of death</td>
          <td>Same date as Final Return due date</td>
          <td>Same date as Final Return due date</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>GRE Income</td>
          <td>Income from the Graduated Rate Estate of another taxpayer**</td>
          <td>From date the fiscal year-end of the GRE to date of death</td>
          <td>Same date as Final Return due date</td>
          <td>Same date as Final Return due date</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>
    <p><i>*Sole proprietorships almost always have a fiscal-end of December 31, so most SPs likely do not qualify to file this optional return.</i></p>
    <p><i>**GREs (Graduated Rate Estate) are trusts that that represents the estate of another deceased individual.</i></p>
    <div class="box">
	    <p><b>Example 2</b></p>
      <p>Alexia died on 12 December 2024 and earned, but had not received a bonus of $45k at the time of death. The bonus was only recieved on 2 January 2025. The estate itself had no major expenses, save $200k of capital gains as a result of deemed disposition. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Capital gains are included as income at 50%, so the taxable income for the capital gains is $100k</li>
        <li>The estate can elect to file a final return with the bonus (net income of $145k) OR file the final return (net income of $100k) alongside a Right or Things return (net income of $45k)</li>
        <li>By filing a singular final tax return, the tax paid is $39.4k, compared to 26.4k by filing two returns. In this case, the estate should elect to file the optional return.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>In the period that the estate winds down, it is possible for the estate to receive income that was earned and received after the date of death. In these cases, post-death funds are not included with the final return. Instead, estates are treated as testamentary trusts (even if the will does not explicitly create a trust) by operation of law under provisions of the Act. As the estate is considered a trust, post-death income must be reported on a T3 Trust return, instead of the usual T1 Personal return.</p>
    <div class="box">
	    <p><b>Example 3</b></p>
      <p>Lilith dies on 25 March 2024 and was expecting a bonus of $10k which was to be paid out, but had not been out until 1 May 2024. Likewise, a company Lilith owned declared a dividend of $15k on 30 March, which was paid out just a few days later.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The bonus was earned before death, so it can be included on the Final T1 return or an optional return, depending on the choice of the trustee(s)</li>
        <li>The dividend was declared, and thus ‘earned’ after death, so it is included on the estate’s T3 return, to be filed 90 years after the trust’s tax year-end</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>In summary, this article has introduced a few key tax and estate implications of death:
    <ul>
      <li>Probate fees</li>
      <li>Deemed disposition of capital property, triggering capital gains</li>
      <li>Deemed withdrawals of certain registered plans</li>
      <li>Income taxation of post-death income as a trust, which are subject to the highest marginal tax rates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The next article will explore how each consequence can be minimized or deferred through strategic planning.</p>
