	    <p><b>Example XX</b></p>
      <p>Remi is a Canadian resident about to start a crochet business. She has guaranteed contracts which will result in projected profits of $500k at the end of the first year. She is curious if she should operate as a sole proprietorship or incorporate. Assume, where applicable, that there is no other income, and that the business only operates in Ontario. She said that she only needs to draw a $150k salary.</p>

      <p>As a Canadian tax resident, Remi's corporation will qualify as a CCPC and be eligible for the SBD. Retained corporate income will be taxed at 12.2% combined, to $500k. In contrast, a significant portion of Remi's income would be taxed at the top personal marginal tax bracket (53% combined federal/ON). Obviously, the corporation's tax rates are much lower than personal rates, leaving the corporation with funds for reinvestment.
