Hi! I'm <b>Ken</b>, an IB student based in Toronto! I file Canadian tax returns for individuals (T1), small & medium-sized businesses, and corporations (T2) — including NPOs. I also write <i>MaxMillions with Ken</i>, a biweekly publication that makes Canadian tax and financial policy accessible to everyone. In my free time, I enjoy listening to Canadian '80s tunes and exploring Toronto. Proudly Canadian — go Leafs! &#127809;
