Hi! I'm <b>Ken Lee, PFA</b>, a Financial Advisor and Tax Planner based in Toronto! I file Canadian tax returns for individuals (T1) and select corporations (T2), such as NPOs. I also write <i>MaxMillions with Ken</i>, a biweekly publication that aims to make insights on key and relevant Canadian tax/financial policy accessible to all Canadians. In my free time, I enjoy listening to Canadian '80s tunes and exploring Toronto. Proudly Canadian — go Leafs! &#127809;
